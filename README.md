# PySM 3

PySM generates full-sky simulations of Galactic emissions in intensity and polarization relevant to CMB experiments.
It is a large refactor of [PySM 2](https://github.com/bthorne93/PySM_public) focused on reducing memory usage,
improving performance and run in parallel with MPI.

See the documentation at <https://pysm3.readthedocs.io>

# Summary

The Python Sky Model (PySM) is a Python package used by Cosmic Microwave Background experiments to simulate maps (in HEALPix [@gorski05,@healpy09] pixelization) of all the different components of the Galactic emission (i.e. dust, synchrotron, free-free and Anomalous Microwave Emission) and the Cosmic Microwave Background as observed by their instrument (i.e. integrated over the instrument bandpass and smoothed with the instrument beam).

PySM 2 [@pysm17], released in 2016, has become the de-facto standard for simulating Galactic emission, for example it is used by CMB-S4, Simons Observatory, LiteBird, PICO, CLASS, POLARBEAR and other CMB experiments.
